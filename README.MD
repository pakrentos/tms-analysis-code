This git repository contains code written in Python and R that is used for various purposes related to statistical analysis of EEG data, such as extracting MBRT (a measure of brain activity) and analyzing the properties of reconstructed functional networks. The code in the Python folder is used to perform these tasks and potentially others related to statistical analysis of EEG data.

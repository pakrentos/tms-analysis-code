This git repository contains scripts written in FieldTrip (MATLAB) and Python that are used for various purposes related to sensor-level and statistical analysis of EEG data, such as extracting motor imagery brain response time (MIBRT, a measure of brain activity), estimation and analysis of source-level power distributions, reconstruction of functional connectivities in source space, and analyzing the properties of reconstructed functional connectivities.

The scripts in the FieldTrip folder:
